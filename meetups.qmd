## Future meet-ups

We hold online meetups, over Zoom. 

For the EMEA/AMER meet-up, these will usually be on the **last Wednesday of each month, at 4:30pm UK time** (i.e. 3:30pm UTC in the summer, 4:30pm UTC in the winter).

For the APAC meet-up, these will usually be on the **last Monday of each month, at 1pm Canberra time** (i.e. 2am UTC in the summer, 3am UTC in the winter). *Note that although we're calling this the APAC region meet-up, this timezone could also work well for folks on the Western side of the Americas.*

We schedule the meet-ups as recurring Zoom meetings. You only need to register once (per meetup series) you'll get a calendar invitation for all future scheduled meet-ups (though of course no requirement to come to all of them!).

Details will also be shared via [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR){target="_blank"}, [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rainbowr.org), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rainbowr/) and our newsletter^[You can opt-in to the newsletter when you [join the community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/){target="_blank"}.] in the run-up to each meet-up.

## About our meet-ups

We usually promote meetups a couple of weeks before they take place.
The best place to hear about them is on [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rainbowr.org), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rainbowr) or via our mailing list, which you can opt in to when you [join](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/).

These are friendly, informal gatherings, to connect with fellow community members and chat (mostly about R).

Each meetup starts with a round of introductions, followed by any updates from the rainbowR team, e.g. discussing initiatives for the group, community organisation etc.
The majority of the meetup is usually spent chatting about R. We invite participants to 'show and tell' -- they can share something related to R or Quarto.
It could be something they're working on, or a resource/package they've found that they're enjoying using.
It's also a chance to ask R-related questions -- there's probably someone on the call who can help!
Of course, you don't have to show something -- there's no pressure to do so!

We require registration in advance. This helps keep the meetup safe.
