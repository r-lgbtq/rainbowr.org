You only need to register once (per meetup series) you'll get a calendar invitation for all future scheduled meet-ups (though of course no requirement to come to all of them!).\n\nDetails will also be shared via [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR){target=\"_blank\"}, [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rainbowr.org), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rainbowr/) and our newsletter^[You can opt-in to the newsletter when you [join the community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/){target=\"_blank\"}.] in the run-up to each meet-up.\n\n## About our meet-ups\n\nWe usually promote meetups a couple of weeks before they take place.\nThe best place to hear about them is on [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@rainbowR), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rainbowr.org), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rainbowr) or via our mailing list, which you can opt in to when you [join](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/).\n\nThese are friendly, informal gatherings, to connect with fellow community members and chat (mostly about R).\n\nEach meetup starts with a round of introductions, followed by any updates from the rainbowR team, e.g. discussing initiatives for the group, community organisation etc.\nThe majority of the meetup is usually spent chatting about R. We invite participants to 'show and tell' -- they can share something related to R or Quarto.\nIt could be something they're working on, or a resource/package they've found that they're enjoying using.\nIt's also a chance to ask R-related questions -- there's probably someone on the call who can help!\nOf course, you don't have to show something -- there's no pressure to do so!\n\nWe require registration in advance. This helps keep the meetup safe.\n",
