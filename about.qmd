rainbowR is a community that supports, promotes and connects LGBTQ+ people who code in the R language, and spreads awareness of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven activism. 

We are a friendly and safe community, providing opportunities for LGBTQ+ people with an interest in R to meet, chat and learn.

We use LGBTQ+ people as a term to cover

-   those who identify as being a minority sexual orientation, i.e. those who are not straight/heterosexual

-   those who are not cisgender, i.e. those whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex

To our straight, cis friends: we very much appreciate your allyship and your support of rainbowR, e.g. by sharing our information and posts on social media and by telling your friends and colleagues about us.

We run activities and initiatives, including monthly [meet-ups](meetups.qmd), the [buddies](buddies.qmd) scheme, and a [book club](book-club.qmd).
